Title of the project: PACMEN

Description of the project: 
This project takes you back to childhood. It takes the well known Pacman and makes it bounce all over the screen. The fun part of it, is that you can create as many Pacmen as you desire. You can add them before the game starts or anytime during the game.

How to Run: Put all the files in the repository in the same folder. Then, just open de index.html file. You will find two buttons at the top. Add as many pacmans as you like with the the "Add PacMan"button, click on the "Start game" and the Pacmen will start bouncing all around the screen.

Roadmap of future improvements: The next step in the project is to add walls in the screen so the Pacmen bounce funnier.
